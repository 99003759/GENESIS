   What is model based engineering/design
	1.Requirement Model
		SYSML
      	2.System Models
	  Sub-System
	3.Function Simulation 
	4.Analysis Models
	5.Test Simulation Models
	6.Hardware Simulation Models
	7.System integration Models
Why do model based approach?
 To improve communication        To improve Quality
 To increase Productivity        To Reduce Risk


When "Not to" adopt model based approach
1.you cannot model everything
2.Hard to model non-functional

 to save simulink model
1.open commanly used blocks in library
sources is input signals
sinks are outputs
until we click on the block it does not show name to change it by click format show block name
to change stope time if we need
click on out in workspace
and click simulaton output//t.out
go to simulation and modeling give contol e and go to slover details change max step size to change samples
