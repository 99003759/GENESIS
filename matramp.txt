saving matlab file
 filename.mat.....command>>save filename

use clear to empty the workspace

Load the variables from the file >> load filename


Display the contents of the variable >>variable name

The clear function cleans up the workspace. 
You can use the clc command to clean up the Command Window.

The file myData.mat contains multiple variables. It was previously created for this further practice. Try loading just the variable k:
>> load myData k

Then try saving the variable k to a new MAT-file called justk.mat:
>> save justk k


MATLAB contains a wide variety of built-in functions, such as abs (absolute value) and eig (calculate eigenvalues).

 you know the number of elements you want in a vector (instead of the spacing between each element), you could instead use the linspace function:
linspace(first,last,number_of_elements).

Both linspace and the : operator create row vectors. However, you can convert a row vector into a column vector using the transpose operator (').
x = 1:3;
x = x'
x = 
    1
    2
    3

You can create column vectors in a single command by creating the row vector and transposing it all on one line. Note the use of parentheses here to specify the order of operations.
x = (1:2:5)'
x = 
    1
    3

MATLAB contains many functions that help you to create commonly used matrices, such as matrices of random numbers.
x = rand(2)
x = 
    0.8147    0.1270
    0.9058    0.9134
Note that the 2 in the command rand(2) specifies that the output will be a 2-by-2 matrix of random numbers.

Most array creation functions accept the same inputs as rand. For example, the zeros and ones functions create matrices of all zeros or ones, respectively.
x = ones(2,3)
x = 
    1    1    1
    1    1    1

You can use the MATLAB keyword end as either a row or column index to reference the last element.
y = A(end,2)


When used as an index, the colon operator (:) specifies all the elements in that dimension. The syntax
x = A(2,:)
creates a row vector containing all of the elements from the second row of A.


The colon operator can refer to a range of values. The following syntax creates a matrix containing the first, second, and third rows of the matrix A.
x = A(1:3,:)
volumes = data(:,end-1:end)


A single index value can be used to reference vector elements. For example
x = v(3)
returns the third element of vector v when v is either a row or column vector.

A single range of index values can be used to reference a subset of vector elements. For example
x = v(3:end)
returns a subset of vector v containing the elements from 3 to the end.
